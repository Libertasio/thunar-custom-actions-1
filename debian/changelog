thunar-custom-actions (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add PDF concatenation action
  * add PDF file size shrinker

thunar-custom-actions (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * fix actions for filenames with spaces
  * fix another merging bug: comparison now only ignores name and description,
    BUT the command is taken into account. This should widely prevent the
    already present user custom actions from being mistakenly removed.

thunar-custom-actions (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add images to A4 PDF custom action
  * fix another merging bug (now if the actions is already present, delete it,
    then re-add it)
  * let uca-apply without arguments do "update" for the user, not for all
    users

thunar-custom-actions (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * another attempt to fix the installation bugs

 -- Yann Büchau <nobodyinperson@gmx.de>  Wed, 07 Jun 2017 09:26:12 +0200

thunar-custom-actions (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * on installation from the graphical update manager as normal user, v0.0.2
    merges the system-wide uca into the root folder / which is of course
    bogus. This is an attempt to fix this.
  * the resize actions had the same icon, patterns and file types, thus only
    one was merged... Luckily, there is a similar icon view-restore-symbolic

thunar-custom-actions (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add some image-related custom actions
  * use M4 to pre-process the system-uca xml files for easy maintenance
  * add English translation
  * add progressbar with zenity for multiple-file-selections
  * It is very important to back up own custom actions as they might be
    deleted on an update or manual "uca-apply remove" if the icon, the
    patterns and the file types match exactly.
