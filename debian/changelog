thunar-custom-actions (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * on installation from the graphical update manager as normal user, v0.0.2
    merges the system-wide uca into the root folder / which is of course
    bogus. This is an attempt to fix this.
  * the resize actions had the same icon, patterns and file types, thus only
    one was merged... Luckily, there is a similar icon view-restore-symbolic

thunar-custom-actions (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add some image-related custom actions
  * use M4 to pre-process the system-uca xml files for easy maintenance
  * add English translation
  * add progressbar with zenity for multiple-file-selections
  * It is very important to back up own custom actions as they might be
    deleted on an update or manual "uca-apply remove" if the icon, the
    patterns and the file types match exactly.
